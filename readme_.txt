Token price is fixed in cents.
It is set to increase automatically at every hour (just for testing), we can set it
at monthly/yearly as requirement.
Increase rate is also manual, we can set at which rate it increats. eg 30cents each month.
Answer of the question is in the code as mint functions allows us to mint more tokens after ICO.
Other functions also can be implemented as required.
